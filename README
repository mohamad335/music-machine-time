scrape the top 100 song titles on that date into a Python List.

then from the list that i created (look at line 2)  we get the songs and search it on spotify and get it on uris_list
finally we create a new playlist on spotify by add the songs on uris_list
hint i use .env to client id and client secret id and uri
